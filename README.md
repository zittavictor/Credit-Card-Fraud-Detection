## Credit Card Fraud Detection 🕵️‍♂️💳

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It leverages a dataset of real-world transactions to train models that can distinguish between genuine and fraudulent activities with high accuracy.

### 📂 Project Structure

* `Credit Card Detection.ipynb` - The main Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

### 🚀 Features

* Data preprocessing and exploration
* Handling class imbalance using resampling techniques
* Model training using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
* Performance evaluation using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
* Visualization of results
